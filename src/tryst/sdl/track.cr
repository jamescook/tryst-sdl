    # One playback slot on a mixer: an object the caller holds, carrying
    # a single audio input, its own gain, and its own play/pause/stop
    # state. There is no limit on how many can exist at once.
    #
    # A track is not usually constructed directly - `Sound#play_track`
    # and `Music` make them - but doing so is legal and is how a caller
    # would reuse one slot for a series of different sounds.

      # A counter rather than a flag so that a track which stops, is

      # instead of the second one being swallowed.

      # Exactly one writer - the audio thread, through `increment` - and
      # exactly one reader, the main thread in `deliver_stopped`. That is
      # what makes a plain aligned Int32 enough here without atomics: no
      # two threads ever write it, so the worst case is the main thread
      # reading a value one behind and delivering on the next dispatch.
      #
      # A struct behind a pointer has VALUE semantics, so `pointer.value
      # .count += 1` would increment a copy and discard it. `increment`
      # copies into a local, changes that, and writes the whole struct
