# SDL3 core bindings, and the one place the whole shard's link flags are
# declared. `lib LibSDL` is reopened by the other files in this directory;
# this is the block that carries the @[Link].
#
# LINKING. pkg-config knows SDL3 by lowercase, hyphenated names: sdl3,
# sdl3-mixer, sdl3-image, sdl3-ttf. The CMake-style spelling (SDL3_mixer,
# SDL3_image, ...) is the one that comes to mind first, and there is no
# .pc file under those names - so `pkg-config --libs SDL3_mixer` fails,
# contributes nothing to the link line, and the build dies much later in
# a wall of undefined _MIX_* references instead of saying "no such
# package". Worth knowing before losing an afternoon to it.
#
# One @[Link] naming all four packages in a single pkg-config call, not
# one annotation per library. Every satellite .pc requires sdl3, so
# asking separately gets -lSDL3 and its -Wl,-rpath back four times over
# and the macOS linker warns about each duplicate on every build; one
# invocation lets pkg-config collapse them.
#
# Nothing platform-specific in these flags, deliberately. tryst's own
# interp.cr has to probe `brew --prefix tcl-tk@8` because that formula is
# KEG-ONLY - Homebrew keeps it out of the default prefix, so its .pc file
# is off pkg-config's search path unless you go looking. None of the four
# SDL3 formulae are keg-only: they install into the normal prefix and
# pkg-config finds them unaided, exactly as apt's libsdl3-*-dev do. Every
# supported platform answers through the same pkg-config branch, so a
# macOS-only fallback would be a branch no build ever takes.
#
# The bare -l fallback is for a box with no pkg-config at all, where the
# libraries are expected in the linker's default search path.
