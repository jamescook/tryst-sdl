    # An SDL3_mixer mixer: the thing audio is loaded into and played
    # through. Two kinds, and the difference matters:
    #
    # - `Mixer.new` opens an audio device and mixes in real time on SDL's
    #   own audio thread. What an application wants.
    # - `Mixer.buffered` has no device at all and produces audio only
    #   when `#generate` asks, as fast as it is asked. What a test wants:
    #   no hardware, no waiting, and the mixed samples in hand.
    #
    # A mixer is an object you make and own; there is no implicit global
    # one. `Mixer.default` is a settable convenience for code that does
    # not want to name one, and nothing else reaches for it.

      # back whatever was set here.

      # Which means a tag alone cannot be an effects slider that keeps
      # sounds at their relative volumes: setting the tag flattens every
      # tagged track to the same gain. An application that mixes a quiet
      # footstep against a loud explosion has to keep each sound's base
