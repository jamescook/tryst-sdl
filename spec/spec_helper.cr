# `crystal spec` compiles every spec file into ONE binary and runs it in
# ONE process, so SDL's global state is shared across files here: an
# example that leaves a subsystem up leaves it up for whatever runs next,
# and SDL_Quit in one file tears down what another file initialized.
# Every example below therefore brings up exactly what it needs and puts
# it back in an `ensure`, and none of them assume a clean slate beyond
# what they set up themselves.
#
# The lowest supported version of all four libraries, matching the
# `libraries:` block in shard.yml. Below this, SDL3_mixer's API was still
# a release candidate and does not match what this shard binds.

# The suite runs silent, and not by accident.
#
# Most audio examples use a buffered mixer, which has no device and so
# cannot make a sound whatever it mixes. But AudioStream opens a real
# device by definition, and anything that read Mixer.default without
# setting it first would open one too - so without this, running the
# specs on a developer's machine would play a series of square-wave beeps
# through the speakers.
#
# SDL's "dummy" driver is a complete audio backend that consumes samples
# and discards them. It exercises the whole path - opening a device,
# binding a stream, queueing, pausing, resuming - and reports a device,
# so nothing has to be skipped or stubbed to stay quiet. It also makes
# the host and the container behave identically, which a real sound card
# would not.
#
# Set through the ENVIRONMENT rather than SDL_SetHint, which looks like
# the obvious way and does not survive: SDL_Quit clears every hint, and
# the lifecycle examples call it, so the next SDL_Init after one of them
# would pick the real backend and start playing out loud halfway through
# a run. SDL re-reads the environment on each init, and nothing can clear
# that.
#
# Left alone if already set, so `SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=coreaudio crystal spec`
# is still how you listen to what the specs are producing.

# Runs the block with a device-less mixer and destroys it afterwards.
#
# Almost every audio example uses this rather than a device mixer, and
# the reason is worth stating once: a buffered mixer needs no audio
# hardware, no display, and no waiting. `#generate` mixes on demand and
# hands back the samples, so an example can assert on what was actually
# produced instead of on whether a call returned true. That is what lets
# the identical suite run on a developer's mac and in a container with
# no sound card, with nothing skipped on either.
