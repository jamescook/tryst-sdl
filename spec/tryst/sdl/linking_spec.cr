# What this file is really for: proving the four @[Link] lines in
# lib_sdl.cr found four real, loadable SDL3 libraries. Compiling proves
# the symbols resolved; only calling into each one proves the library
# behind them is present at runtime and is the version this shard expects.
#
# Asserting the major version specifically is what keeps an SDL2 install
# from passing - `pkg-config --libs sdl3` against a box that only has
# SDL2 gives nothing and the bare -lSDL3 fallback then has to find it,
# which is exactly the mistake worth catching loudly.
