# Dev/test image for tryst-sdl. Built from the REPO ROOT as context, not
# from this directory - tryst-sdl depends on tryst through a `path: ../`
# shard dependency, so the parent's src/ and shard.yml have to be inside
# the build context. scripts/docker-test.sh does that for you.
#
# Debian forky rather than the crystallang/crystal image the parent
# project uses, purely for SDL3 packaging: that image is Ubuntu 24.04 and
# has no sdl3 packages at all. Ubuntu 26.04 and Debian trixie carry core,
# image and ttf but not mixer; Alpine edge lacks image and mixer. Debian
# forky (testing) and sid are the only bases with all four, and forky is
# the more stable of the two. Forky still defaults tcl-dev/tk-dev to
# 8.6.18 with no Tcl 9 anywhere in the image, so the project's 8.6-only
# scoping survives the newer base.
#
# Crystal is not in Debian apt, hence the official release tarball below.
#
# Must be run as `docker run --rm --init <image>` - same requirement as
# the parent project's image. Without --init, xvfb-run hangs forever: it
# runs as the container's PID 1, and its Xvfb-readiness handshake relies
# on a SIGUSR1 trap that doesn't fire reliably for PID 1.

# driver, which would make the mixer example prove rather less.
